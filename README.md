# Asymmetric cryptography

How A can send message to B, so that no one but B can read it?

# Setting

|     |   Private  |   Public   |
| :-: | :--------: | :--------: |
|  A  |  pvtA.pem  |  pubA.pem  |
|  B  |  pvtB.pem  |  pubB.pem  |

A and B will exchange their public keys. (It doesn't really matter if anyone else get the public as well)
